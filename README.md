# CRITERIA

**C**idoc c**R**m **I**n **T**urtle m**ER**maid d**I**agr**A**ms (CRITERIA) is a Python tool that converts RDF Turtle files (based on [CIDOC CRM model](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/)) into [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) markdown to generate (flowchart) diagrams.

The tool can generate two types of diagrams using the same Turtle file (which must always contain instances):
* One renders all **instances**, e.g. URIs, dateTime, Literal values
* The other renders only classes, i.e. the **ontology** of the pattern.

The markdown is intended to be incorporated into an HTML page; however, a PNG version can be downloaded from [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor) by simply pasting the entire markdown file into the code box. 

Recommended browsers for Mermaid Live Editor:
* **Mac**: Safari, Chrome, Firefox
* **Windows**: Firefox

Below is an example using CHIN's Birth/Death of People pattern:

##### RDF
* [BirthDeath_Fortin.ttl](/rdf/BirthDeath_Fortin.ttl)

##### Diagram with instances
![Birth/Death of People pattern with instances](/docs/images/BirthDeath_Fortin.png)

##### Ontology representation
![Ontology of Birth/Death of People pattern ](/docs/images/BirthDeathOnto.png)

## Installation
The tool can be installed by cloning this repository or downloading it as a zip file.
It will run in console; see [Usage](#usage) for further instructions.

### Requirements
The following programming language versions of are necessary to run this tool.
- Python 3.7.0
- [rdflib 5.0.0](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/gettingstarted.html)
- **UPDATE**: [rdflib-jsonld 0.5.0](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib-jsonld)

## Usage

### criteria
The main python script is **`criteria.py`**, which requires **three** arguments.
|Argument|Description|
|--|--|
|Type | Type of the diagram; the values must be either **`instance`** or **`ontology`**|
|rdf|  RDF input filename (e.g. `BirthDeath_Fortin.ttl`); input files **must be stored** in the folder `/rdf`<br>>>**Notes**: The tool can now process **other input formats** besides **`Turtle`**, such as **`NTriples`**, **`RDF/XML`**, **`Trig`**, **`JSON-LD`**, etc.|
|mmd|  Mermaid output filename (e.g. `BirthDeath_Fortin.mmd`)|

For example, to generate a diagram rendering instances using the `BirthDeath_Fortin.ttl` file in `./rdf` folder, the command is as follows:
```shell
$  python criteria.py instance BirthDeath_Fortin.ttl BirthDeath_Fortin.mmd
```
### rdf
RDF files used to generate diagrams must be stored in the **`/rdf`** folder.
> **UPDATE**: The tool can now process **prefixes defined by users**.

### mmd
Mermaid files (`.mmd`) are outputed and stored in the **`/mmd`** folder.
> Note: While processing the triples, the script would grab all of them randomly, meaning user would not have much control about the order of statements in the .mmd. However, it also means that running the script over the same Turtle file would generate different Mermaid files (i.e. different order of statements), meaning different graphs (i.e. different positions of the nodes).

### src
The **`/src`** folder contains resources used by the main script.

#### /templates 
The **`templates`** folder contains the templates used to generate the `.mmd` output files. The templates have pre-defined classes for styling: one for visualising instances (`instance.mmd`), the other for visualising only the ontology (`ontology.mmd`). The default styling is based on the color scheme of CIDOC CRM (as proposed by George Bruseker).

For example,
```
graph TD
classDef Literal fill:#f2f2f2,stroke:#000000;
classDef CRM_Entity fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#000000;
classDef CRM_Entity_URI fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#000000;
classDef Temporal_Entity fill:#00C9E6, stroke:#000000;
classDef Temporal_Entity_URI fill:#99f1ff,stroke:#000000;
```
> :warning: At the moment, you can *ONLY edit the colors* in the files, but **DO NOT change the *name of the files* or the *name of the classes* !**

#### /ontologies
This **`ontologies`** folder contains the ontology files used in the script. Currently it contains the `.rdfs` files of main [CIDOC CRM (v6.2.1)](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/Version/version-6.2.1), [FRBRoo (v2.4)](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/frbroo/ModelVersion/frbroo-v.-2.4), [CRMpc (v1.1)](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/Version/version-6.2), and CRMdig (v3.2.2) (retrieved from [FORTH's 3M](https://isl.ics.forth.gr/3M/)).
> :warning: Make sure that the classes in the `.rdfs` **match** the classes used in the `.ttl`
> For example, if your `.ttl` uses `E24_Physical_Human-Made_Thing` but the ontology uses `E24_Physical_Man-Made_Thing` the ontology file must be edited accordingly.

#### source
**`source.py`** is the location where to place several python objects to be imported in the main script. It currently contains:
- `classes`: a list object storing the main CIDOC CRM classes that are to be assigned color codes.
- `onto`: a dictionary object storing the filenames of the ontologies used by the script (i.e. the `.rdfs` files in the folder `/ontologies`).
> :warning: If you replace the `.rdfs` in the folder `/ontologies` with an updated file, or rename it, **the values** in the `onto` dictionary must be updated accordingly.
